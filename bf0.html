<h1>Hi there! :) </h1>

<p>This is a page about a programming language, called BF or Brainfuck(this is the only place I write out the whole name) and it also contains an interpreter which I call BrainFreak, and a short tutorial and a big stack of BF codes.
I gave the site this minimal design because BF is simple, too. The reason is simple too! </p>

<h3> If you are new to BF, what I recommend you to use this site this way: </h3>
<ol>
<li> overview</li>
<li> tutorial and brainfreak at the same time </li>
<li> codes </li>
<li> contact - if you have questions </li>
<li> links </li>
<li> other - some interesting things</li>
</ol>
<h3> At the moment I'm uploading the contents, so please be patient and come back soon! </h3>

<h3>Thanks for visiting the page! :)</h3>
