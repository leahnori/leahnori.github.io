<p>A strange date did I find to open this blog. Yes... it is Xmas! </p>
<p>The reason is very simple. At the moment I am a high-school student in Hungary and because of Xmas, I have a 2 week long holiday. It simply means that I'm having some time to deal with the things I want to deal with. So I decided to make this site(Leah's Lab) and also this blog. I have many projects, smaller or a little bit bigger, and I just wanted to put them into the cloud, so people can have a look at them, and maybe comment on. </p>
<p>So yes, that is it, I hope you will like these things, and I'm curious about your opinions!</p>
<p>Send me an e-mail! - link is next to my pic above!</p>
<p>Bye,<p>
Leah

<p>PS.: Because of Xmas - here is my greeting card - it was made for my Hungarian friends, so the text is is hungarian, it says: Merry Christmas! By NÃ³ri(it's me) 2014.<p>
<p>Also, why it is interesting is that if you have a closer look at it, you can see a BF code in it.: </p>
